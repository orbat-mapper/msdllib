# MSDLlib

**Experimental**

A JavaScript library for parsing Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) data.
Currently, MSDLlib only supports the most commonly used MSDL data structures.

The Military Scenario Definition Language is an XML-based language designed to support military
scenario development. MSDL, also known as [SISO-STD-007-2008](https://www.sisostds.org/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&EntryId=45690&PortalId=0&TabId=105), is a standard developed by the [Simulation Interoperability Standards
Organization (SISO)](https://www.sisostds.org/Home.aspx). For more information about MSDL please
visit the [SISO standards page](https://www.sisostds.org/productspublications/standards/sisostandards.aspx)
and [SISO Product data files page](https://www.sisostds.org/Schemas.aspx).

Please note that MSDL will be superseded by C2SIM-Initialize. You can read more about this on the
[C2SIM project page](https://openc2sim.github.io/).

See [msdl-viewer](https://github.com/orbat-mapper/msdl-viewer) for an example project that uses MSDLlib.

   async function loadMsdlFile(url: string) {
     try {
       const response = await fetch(url);
       const msdlAsText = await response.text();
       const msdlScenario = MilitaryScenario.createFromString(msdlString);
       return msdlScenario;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Failed to load MSDL file", error);
     }
   }

   const msdl = loadMsdlFile("https://example.com/msdl-file.xml");
   console.log(msdl.forceSides[0].toGeoJson());
   ```
